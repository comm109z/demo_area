Workshop 4b

Please find the instructions for this workshop here: 

https://github.com/ipynb-python/Workshop-5b-Instructions/blob/main/README.md

As you work test your code in the terminal e.g.

python workshop5b_part1.py

After completing the exercises please run the following commands in the terminal.

These lines will save your code in three stages:
 - modified files are staged to specify which changes will be commited;
 - staged changes are committed to the local git code repository (on the CodeSpace machine)
 - changes are pushed to the remote master copy of the code repository on GitHub website

git add .
git commit -m "finished exercises"
git push


It is a good habit to commit and push your files
 everytime you have made a significant change. 
 
In this case you can change the commit message, e.g. 

git commit -m "completed part1"
